# AI Pac-Man

AI Pac-Man is an implementation of the classic Pac-Man game, enhanced with artificial intelligence techniques for decision-making and gameplay mechanics. The AI is designed to navigate the maze, avoid ghosts, and maximize score efficiently.

## Features
- AI-controlled Pac-Man using various algorithms
- Ghost behavior simulation
- Pathfinding and decision-making strategies
- Classic Pac-Man mechanics

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YashasSingh/ai-pacman.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ai-pacman
   ```
3. Install dependencies:


## Usage
Run the game using:
```sh
python agents.py
```

## AI Implementation
The AI utilizes algorithms such as:
- **A* Search Algorithm** for optimal pathfinding
- **Minimax Algorithm** for strategic decision-making
- **Reinforcement Learning** for adaptive gameplay

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys** - Manual control (if enabled)
- **AI Mode** - Let the AI control Pac-Man automatically
